# My Portfolio

This is a personal project originally created in 2012, back in the day (remember the tools back then?). It's designed to showcase projects I've worked on & allows easily adding new projects to the list.

It's hosted at [jasonrcurtis.com](http://jasonrcurtis.com)

The interactivity is one of the fun parts - the 'tags' present in the source data are automatically turned into interactive UI elements that allow you to filter the visible projects.
